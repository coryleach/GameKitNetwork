 *	These classes provide a simple way to create, send, and then
 *  dispatch network messages over a GKSession.
 *
 *  NetworkManager does not establish a session for you, instead
 *  you must establish the session and then set the session inside
 *  of NetworkManager to your session. NetworkManager will then take ownership
 *  of the session and set itself as the 'DataReceiveHandler' 
 *
 *  NetworkManager does *NOT* set itself as the session delegate. All connects
 *  and disconnects of peers as well as session creation/establishment are handled
 *  outside of NetowrkManager.
 *
